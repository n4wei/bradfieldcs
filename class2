root --> TLD --> authoritative
there is no rule about having to break down a hostname by subdomains, the TLD could map the entire hostname (vs a subdomain) to the authoritative DNS server with the NS record
the primary purpose of local DNS servers is to cache
network transmission is about twice the speed of light despite routers and queueing
in an iterative DNS request, more DNS servers are caching resource records compared to an iterative DNS request
the response message will contain all the resource records that were returned by every DNS server along a recursive request
- useful for caching
- useful for amplification attacks
normally we set the TTL very high to optimize end users for quick DNS resolution through caching
when one wants to change the IP address already registered to a hostname, one first updates the A record with a low TTL, wait some time, then update to the new IP address
there is another TTL which is a measure of the number of hops, this prevents accumulation of packets when there are loops

syscalls:
for connections: socket -> bind -> listen -> accept, send and receive
for UDP: socket -> bind, sendto and receivefrom
